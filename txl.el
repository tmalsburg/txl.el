;;; Commentary:

;; TXL provides machine translation through DeepL's REST API.
;; Minimally the user needs to specify a pair of languages in the
;; customization variable `txl-languages' and an authentication key
;; for DeepL's REST API via `txl-deepl-api-url'.

;; The command `txl-translate-region-or-paragraph' translates the
;; marked region or, if no region is active, the paragraph to the
;; respective other language.  The current language is detected using
;; the package guess-language.  The retrieved translation is shown in
;; a separate buffer where it can be reviewed and edited.  The
;; original text can be replaced with the (edited) translation via
;; <C-c C-c>.  The translation can be dismissed (without touching the
;; original text) using <C-c C-k>.  If a prefix argument is given
;; (<C-u>), the text will be translated round-trip to the other
;; language and back.
